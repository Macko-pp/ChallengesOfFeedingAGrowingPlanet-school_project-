<h1>Part 1: Worldwide meat consumption</h1>
<p>
	There has been increasing pressure on farmers to produce meat 
	(beef, pork, lamb, chicken and other types of meat that humans eat),
	which has undesirable effects on the environment.
	According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
	Nations, the annual world meat consumption in 1965 was 24.2 kg per
	capita (per person). This had increased to 41.3 kg per capita in 2015.
</p>

<ol type="a">
	
<li class="prose">
	<p>
		A member from the original group of experts determined a model for the meat
		consumption since 1965. They defined what x represents (number of years after
		1965), but forgot to define what the y represents. What does the y represent in
		this context? <b>y=0.342x+24.2</b>
	</p>

		<p class="ml-10">
			I think that, in this context, <b>y</b> represents the meat consumption for the years after 1956. This is because
			we cant have a measure of time (<b>x</b>) but not have something to compare it to. <b>y</b> is measured in kgpc
			(kilograms per capita), I know this because the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations measured their
			findings in kgpc.

			This is the graph of the final equation, according to this graph, the meat consumption per capita gets higher each year and has been since 1965.
		</p>
</li> <br>

<li class="prose">
	<p>
		Experts used the model from part a to predict meat consumption per capita this year (2023)
		Since x represents the number of years since 1965...2023-1965=58
	</p>
		<p class="text-center">
			y=0.342x+24.2 <br>
			y=0.342(58)+24.2 <br>
			y=44.036 <br>
		</p>
	<p>
		The meat consumption per capita in 2023 would be 44.036kg <br>
		Your task: use the model from part a to predict the meat consumption per capita in 2030
	</p>

		<p class="ml-10">
			I predict that the kgpc in 2030 will be 46.43 kg. I got this number by using the same equation used above:
		</p>
		<p class="ml-10 text-center">
			2030 - 1955 = 65 <br>
			
			y=0.342x+24.2 <br>
			y=0.342(65)+24.2 <br>
			y=46.43 <br>
		</p>
		<img src="/p1b.png" alt="a graph with an equation of 'y=0.342x+24.2'" class="w-80 ml-[27%]">
		<p class="ml-10">
			What this equations does is find the intersection between x=65 and the line. Since <b>x</b> is the number of years since 1965 and <b>y</b> is meat consumption in kgpc, this means that the point where they intercept is the meat consumption that year, and you can use this to predict the meat consumption at any time, ever! As long as the meat consumption has remained consistent, which I doubt.
