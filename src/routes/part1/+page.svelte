			A member from the original group of experts determined a model for the meat
			consumption since 1965. They defined what x represents (number of years after
			1965), but forgot to define what the y represents. What does the y represent in
			this context?
		</p>

			<p class="ml-10">
				I think that, in this context, <b>y</b> represents the meat consumption for the years after 1956. This is because
				we cant have a measure of time (<b>x</b>) but not have something to compare it to. <b>y</b> is measured in kg/c
				(kilograms per capita), I know this because the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations measured their
				findings in kgpc.

				This is the graph of the final equation, according to this graph, the meat consumtion per capita gets higher each year and has been since 1965.
