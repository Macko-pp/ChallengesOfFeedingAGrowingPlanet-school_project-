<h1>Part 2: The Brazilian Rainforest</h1>
<p>
	Approximately 70% of clearcutting (cutting down all or most
	trees in an area) in the Brazilian rainforest is to provide land for
	cattle ranches and farming. This accounts for almost 15% of the
	world's total annual deforestation, making it the largest cause of
	deforestation worldwide.
	The graph below represents the forest cover in the Brazilian
	Rainforest since 1970.

				What does the gradient actually mean in this context of <b>deforestation</b>?
			</p>

				<p class="ml-10">
					In this context, the gradient or slope means how fast the area the forest is currently occupying is diminishing. Or in other words, <b>how fast we are cutting it down</b> to make space for cattle, livestock or crop fields. It also means that, according to tre calculations, <b>the forest will completely disappear by 2,273</b> if we don't stop or at least slow down.

				What does the <b>y-intercept</b> represent?

	<p>
		To put this area in perspective, <b>research the area</b> of the city or town you live in, in square kilometers. <b>How does it compare</b> with the area of the rainforest that is cleared each year?
	</p>

		<p class="ml-10">
			The area of the city I live in, cali, is <b>560.3 km<sup>2</sup></b>.
			<br><br>
			Although it may seem big, as it is the second largest city in the country, it is but a measly <b>0.014%</b> compared to the area taken up by the brazilian rainforest in 1970. Unfortunately, the city currently occupies <b>0.018%</b> of the entire forest, meaning that the forest is shrinking, and rapidly.

</li> <br>

<li class="prose">
	<p>
		Given the calculated rate of area clearcut each year (your answer in part a), how long would it take to clearcut an area of the rainforest that is the size of your town or city?
	</p>
	
		<p class="ml-10 text-center">
			0.014% (area of cali to area of forest) of 250 (years to cut down whole forest) = 0.035 <br>
			0.035 * 360 = <b>12.6</b> (days to cut down cali)
		</p>

		<p class="ml-10">
			This really puts into scale the rate at which we are cutting down the forest. It is really astounding how we are able to cut down a forest the size of the second largest city in the country in just under a couple of weeks.

		Some scientists warn that the rainforest cannot deplete in size to less than 70% of its 1970 size without catastrophic irreversible consequences to the rainforest ecosystem. <br> <br>

		If clearcutting continues at the constant rate represented in the graph, in what year would that occur?

		<p class="ml-10">
			The brazilian rainforest will decrease below 70% of its size in 1970 in <b>2045</b>.

		Research and include two reasons FOR and two reasons AGAINST the deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest
	</p>
	
		<div class="ml-10">
			Reasons <b>FOR</b> deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest:

				<ol>
					<li>
						Agricultural Expansion: The fertile soil and abundant land of the Amazon rainforest make it an attractive option for agriculture and livestock farming. Deforestation allows for the expansion of these industries, providing food and jobs for the growing population.
					</li>

					<li>
						Economic Development: Deforestation can also provide a source of income for local communities through the sale of timber, minerals, and other resources. This can drive economic development and reduce poverty in the region.
					</li>
				</ol>

			Reasons <b>AGAINST</b> deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest:

				<ol>
					<li>
						Environmental Impacts: Deforestation can have devastating effects on the local environment and the planet as a whole. It can cause soil erosion, reduce biodiversity, disrupt water cycles, and contribute to climate change by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
					</li>

					<li>
						Indigenous People: The Amazon rainforest is home to many indigenous communities who rely on the forest for their livelihoods. Deforestation can displace these communities, destroying their homes and ways of life, and putting their survival at risk.

	<h2><b>End Goal:</b></h2>
	<p>
		Determine and explain when meat consumption and deforestation would be unsustainable.
	</p>
	
		<p class="ml-10">
			Scientists suspect that the brazilian rainforest shall become unsustainable when its size reaches below 70% of its size in 1970. I predict, using the data given to me by the document, that meat consumption will become unsustainable as soon as the forest becomes unsustainable. 
			<br><br>
			Meat consumption and deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest are considered unsustainable when they occur at a rate that exceeds the capacity of the ecosystem to regenerate and sustainably support human activities.
			<br><br>
			The deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest for agriculture and livestock farming has a significant impact on the local environment and the planet. Clearing large areas of forest releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and reducing biodiversity. The soil in deforested areas is also prone to erosion, which can cause long-term damage to the land and limit its ability to support agriculture and other land uses.
			<br><br>
			Meat consumption also contributes to deforestation, as the demand for meat requires more land for livestock and feed crops. This leads to the clearing of forests and other habitats, reducing biodiversity and contributing to climate change.
			<br><br>
			Therefore, sustainable meat consumption and deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest requires balancing the demand for food and other resources with the need to maintain the health and integrity of the ecosystem. This may involve implementing practices such as sustainable agriculture and forestry, reducing waste and inefficiencies in the food system, and promoting conservation and restoration efforts.
